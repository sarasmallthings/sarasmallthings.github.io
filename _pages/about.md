    <p> Hi, I'm Sara Stegman, and welcome to my little corner of the internet! I started this website as a place to share my love for cooking, especially my favorite sourdough recipes that I've perfected. Here, you'll find a collection of recipes that bring joy to my kitchen — from crusty loaves of sourdough to delicious, comforting meals. I’ve included photos of my creations, along with tips and tricks to help you recreate them at home. Whether you're a seasoned cook or a beginner, I hope these recipes inspire you to get in the kitchen and enjoy the magic of homemade food. Happy cooking! </p>
