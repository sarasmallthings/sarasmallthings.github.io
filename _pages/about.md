    <p> Welcome, small foodie! My name is Sara and you've found my humble corner of the internet to satisfy all your cravings. I have found such a joy in the art of cooking and baking that I am overflowing with delusional elation to share my recipes with you! My heart pitter patters when I see a beautifully crafted and vibrant plate, but nothing makes me happier than sharing these meals and experiences with my loved ones. So, I insist, indulge yourself in the little moments life offers you and all the small things will add up to a plentiful plate and happy soul. Whether you're a novice cook or wizard in the kitchen, I hope these recipes can inspire you to get in your kitchen and cook up your love for homemade food. Happy cooking, small foodie!</p>
